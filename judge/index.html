		<h1>Seeking judicial seat, willing to relocate</h1>
			<div class="chatter">The state Supreme Court put longtime Lake County resident James L. Kaplan on the Cook County bench in 2010, and gave him a second appointment in 2012. Kaplan has rented two different condos in those subcircuits while his family remains in their Lincolnshire home. A continuing joint probe by <b>Medill Watchdog</b> at Northwestern University and <b>WGN Investigates</b> reveals how Judge Kaplan jumped from subcircuit to subcircuit to hold onto a spot on the bench.</div>

					<div id="middle">When the state Supreme Court prepared to appoint him in 2010 to a vacant judicial seat in Cook County's 8th subcircuit, Kaplan rented a condominium in Chicago's River North neighborhood.<p>He took the bench, but lost the March 2012 Democratic primary to fill that seat. His appointment remained effective until Dec. 3, 2012.</p></div>
					<div id="last">After he lost the primary to fill that 8th subcircuit seat, the state Supreme Court gave him another appointment: This one, an appointment to a vacancy in the 12th subcircuit, covering Cook County's North Shore suburbs.<p>Kaplan rented another condominium &mdash; this time, in Glenview &mdash; and now is a candidate to hold onto his seat in the coming March Democratic primary.</p></div>
